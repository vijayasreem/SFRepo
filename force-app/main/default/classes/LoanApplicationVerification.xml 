    <description>A secure loan application process to verify documents, pre-qualify customers for loan amounts and interest rates, assess vehicles, accept loan offers, and disburse loans</description>
    <userStory>As a Salesforce developer, I want to develop a secure loan application process that verifies documents, pre-qualifies customers for loan amounts and interest rates, assesses vehicles, accepts loan offers, and disburses loans so that customers can receive loan offers with specific terms and conditions.</userStory>
    <acceptanceCriteria>The loan application process should be secure. The customer's documents should be verified. The customer should be pre-qualified for a loan amount and interest rate range. The loan should be approved with specific terms and conditions. The vehicle should be assessed if necessary. The loan offer should be accepted. The loan should be disbursed. The Document Verification App should greet the user with a welcoming message. The app should verify identity and address as "yes" or "no" using the provided input. If both identity and address are verified, the app should display a success message indicating eligibility for banking services. If both identity and address are not verified, the app should display a message indicating that document verification is incomplete and not eligible for banking services. The app should determine eligibility for a credit score based on annual income and credit score. The app should gracefully close and any resources like the Scanner should be properly closed after receiving the eligibility determination message. The system should determine whether the payment is approved based on the payment amount. If Payments equal to or less than $1000.0 amount will be automatically approved. The system should display a message indicating the successful disbursement process, including the vendor's name and the payment amount, if the vendor information is verified, funds availability is confirmed, and payment approval is granted. The system should display a message indicating that the vendor information is invalid if the vendor information verification fails. The system should display a message indicating the lack of funds if there are insufficient funds for disbursement. The system should prompt for payment approval if payment approval is required and not granted.</acceptanceCriteria>
